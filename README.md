Alternatively, if you need or prefer to manually install the plugin, you can do so following these steps:

## Frequently Asked Questions

##### Can I run the plugin on a WordPress install that isn't publicly accessible?
Yes, it will work whether it is public or not however features requiring a call-back to your site such as status updates, etc will be unavailable.

##### Are there any filters for plugin/theme developers?
* `brightcove_account_actions = [edit, delete];` - What actions are available when manipulating a Brightcove source.
* `brightcove_video_html` - Filter the HTML output.
* `brightcove_account_actions` - Filter the available actions for each source on the Brightcove admin settings page.
* `brightcove_api_callbacks` - Filter the callback URLs passed for Dynamic Ingest requests.
* `brightcove_proxy_cache_time_in_seconds` - Filter the length of time to cache proxied remote calls to the Brightcove API.

##### Will this work on multisite?
Yes it will.

##### Can I use more than one Brightcove account?
Yes, you can add sources from many Brightcove accounts if you want.

##### How does sync work?
The plugin simply pulls information directly from the Brightcove API for display and does not sync videos locally.

##### How can I increase Maximum upload file size?
Maximum file size is determined by your webserver and PHP configuration. You need to set the value of upload_max_filesize and post_max_size in your php.ini. php_ini_loaded_file() can help you find where your PHP.ini is located.

##### How do I add custom fields?
Custom fields must be created within your Brightcove Video Cloud account. Once created, the fields will be available within WordPress.

##### How do I enable change tracking so I can see who updated a video and when they did it?
Create a custom field of type 'text' with an internal name of '_change_history'. Whenever a video is updated, the username and current time will be added to a list of changes recorded in this field.
